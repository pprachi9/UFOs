# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project was to create a sight that could filter through UFO sightings based on date, city and state, and shape.

## Results

The webpage for UFO Sightings has been created. This is the first thing the viewers will see upon entering the webpage:

## Summary

### Drawbacks

The user has to know atleast two exact things like (dates or citiy )or (citiy or state) to generate the data in the table and for different countries we has to specify country name beside the city name to generate the data in the table otherwise it will not genetrate the data.

### Recommendations

To have more data available like how many people sighted the UFO and the at what time the sighting was visible. To create additional filter boxes to add the name and contact information of the people who sighted the UFO and their observations which might be helpful in better understanding to the researchers who are studying and analysing the UFO Sightings.
